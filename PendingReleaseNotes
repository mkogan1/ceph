14.2.15
---------

* MON: The cluster log now logs health detail every ``mon_health_to_clog_interval``,
  which has been changed from 1hr to 10min. Logging of health detail will be
  skipped if there is no change in health summary since last known.

* MGR: progress module can now be turned on/off, using the commands:
  ``ceph progress on`` and ``ceph progress off``.

14.2.13
-------

* $pid expansion in config paths like `admin_socket` will now properly expand
  to the daemon pid for commands like `ceph-mds` or `ceph-osd`. Previously only
  `ceph-fuse`/`rbd-nbd` expanded `$pid` with the actual daemon pid.
