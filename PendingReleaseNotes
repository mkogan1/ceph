>= 14.2.11
----------

* The allowable options for some "radosgw-admin" commands have been changed.

  * "mdlog-list", "datalog-list", "sync-error-list" no longer accepts
    start and end dates, but does accept a single optional start marker.
  * "mdlog-trim", "datalog-trim", "sync-error-trim" only accept a
    single marker giving the end of the trimmed range.

* RGW: The ``radosgw-admin`` sub-commands dealing with orphans --
  ``radosgw-admin orphans find``, ``radosgw-admin orphans finish``,
  ``radosgw-admin orphans list-jobs`` -- have been deprecated. They
  have not been actively maintained and they store intermediate
  results on the cluster, which could fill a nearly-full cluster.
  They have been replaced by a tool, currently considered
  experimental, ``rgw-orphan-list``.

* Now when noscrub and/or nodeep-scrub flags are set globally or per pool,
  scheduled scrubs of the type disabled will be aborted. All user initiated
  scrubs are NOT interrupted.

* Monitors now have a config option ``mon_osd_warn_num_repaired``, 10 by default.
  If any OSD has repaired more than this many I/O errors in stored data a
  ``OSD_TOO_MANY_REPAIRS`` health warning is generated.  In order to allow
  clearing of the warning, a new command ``ceph tell osd.# clear_shards_repaired [count]``
  has been added.  By default it will set the repair count to 0.  If you wanted
  to be warned again if additional repairs are performed you can provide a value
  to the command and specify the value of ``mon_osd_warn_num_repaired``.
  This command will be replaced in future releases by the health mute/unmute feature.

>=14.2.15
---------

* MON: The cluster log now logs health detail every ``mon_health_to_clog_interval``,
  which has been changed from 1hr to 10min. Logging of health detail will be
  skipped if there is no change in health summary since last known.

* MGR: progress module can now be turned on/off, using the commands:
  ``ceph progress on`` and ``ceph progress off``.

14.2.13
-------

* This release fixes a regression introduced in 14.2.12 which broke deployments
  that referred to MON hosts using DNS names instead of IP addresses in the
  ``mon_host`` parameter in ``/etc/ceph/ceph.conf``.
