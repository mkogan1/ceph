14.2.19
-------
* The RGW policy parser can reject unknown principals. If you are
  not mirroring policies between RGW and AWS, you may wish to set
  "rgw policy reject invalid principals" to "true".
  This affects only newly set policies, not policies that are already in place.
* OSD: the option ``osd_fast_shutdown_notify_mon`` has been introduced to allow
  the OSD to notify the monitor it is shutting down even if ``osd_fast_shutdown``
  is enabled. This helps with the monitor logs on larger clusters, that may get
  many 'osd.X reported immediately failed by osd.Y' messages, and confuse tools.

14.2.18
-------

* This release fixes issues loading the dashboard and volumes manager
  modules in some environments.
